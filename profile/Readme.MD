The “FAIR Forward – Artificial Intelligence for all” initiative promotes a more open, inclusive and sustainable approach to AI on an international level. It is implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). FAIR Forward seeks to improve the foundations for AI innovation and policy in six partner countries: Ghana, India, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. The FAIR Forward project pursues three main goals:    
1. Remove entry barriers to AI (Access to training data and AI technologies for local innovation): FAIR Forward facilitates the provision of open, non-discriminatory and inclusive training data and open source AI applications.  
2. Strengthen local technical know-how on AI (Capacity development in Africa and Asia): FAIR Forward supports digital learning and training for the development and use of AI and fosters cooperation with German and European research institutions and businesses. 
3. Develop policy frameworks ready for AI (Ethical AI, data protection and privacy): FAIR Forward advocates for value-based AI that is rooted in human rights, international norms such as accountability, transparency of decision-making and privacy, and draws on European experiences such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, the project supports the development of effective political and regulatory frameworks in Africa and Asia.
